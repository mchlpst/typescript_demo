# Exercise 5

### Location

`components > Exercise5.vue`

### Introduction

This component needs a number as input to give you certain information about that number. Please note that the way this component is using methods and computed is not ideal. But for the sake of this assessment we do it like this.

Also in the `<script setup>` is missing the `lang="ts"` please add this before starting.

### Assessment

Your task is to let TypeScript know what the function will return. and also make the rest of the script TypeScript.
